_Cat says hi._

This is a site where things get posted ever so slowly. Maybe it is a blog. Maybe it is a gallery. What does it matter? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a62c0f20-741e-448a-bdf1-7bdb80e8d38c.jpg)

_Cat is bored._

So I got this invite to The Grid Beta. It is easy to use, sure. But very empty. I remember The Grid was supposed to auto-generate things. Maybe the functions are not in yet. Maybe that's it, I got scammed. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a3058edd-e247-41fb-8e11-8f06a485f681.jpg)

_Cat scratching head._

Perhaps I was too quick to judge and accuse. I haven't even published this yet. Well, time to give it a roll.
