Hello again.

This is another post. It has been too long since my last. 

Don't Make Me Think!

_- Some UX Expert_

We have reached a time where AI should take over and interpret content into a visual website. Yet, this is not what we expected. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/63396c95-3d3d-468d-b70e-8e88cc42f236.jpg)

What we have here isn't quite AI. This feels quite like a website builder, except with a few sliders that I think were supposed to be AI but ended up being simple heuristics to decide the site's appearance. It has yet to change anything on my site. Not the old post, not this new one.

I will wait another couple of months to see if they have progress. This Chrome extension they have is useful though. Haven't tried the app yet. Still, website builder, not AI. Peace.
